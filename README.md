This game is modular and though to ease the implementation of more enemy types.
We added 3 types:
- Asteroids, who wander around and explode into smaller ones when fired at.
- Trackers, which are rotating squares moving towards the player (their speed depends of the distance from the player)
- Turrets, which are trying to shoot at the player while derivating in space
